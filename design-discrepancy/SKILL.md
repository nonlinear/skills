```

**Notes:**

**1️⃣ Loads exercise MD:** Opens in Typora for parity

**2️⃣ Trigger + exercise name:** Where do we keep track of exercise name and corresponding MD? Can user ask for list?

**3️⃣ Asks critical info:** Anything under [brackets] in template. Skill knows: date, status.

**4️⃣ Checks access:** Verify access to Figma API, Jira API, Relay ON, etc. **Updates table for each access.** **Follow Connection column links** (e.g., `figma.md`, `jira.md`) - read those files, follow documented methods, don't ask/invent.

**5️⃣ Component inventory:** Runs over each page on system, finds all components and subcomponents, lists them on MD in ordered list.

**6️⃣ Document matching:** Matches all components found against documentation, renames according to documentation. Lists all components not part of documentation (icons, etc). Use `- [ ]` checkbox format. Add progress tracker (e.g., "3 of 12 completed").

**7️⃣ Discrepancy checks:** **Kin only does SPACING checks.** Nicholas does: States, Color, Typography, WCAG.

**Spacing checks (Kin automation):**
- **Padding:** Compare `paddingLeft`, `paddingRight`, `paddingTop`, `paddingBottom` (computed styles vs Figma)
- **Margin:** Compare `marginLeft`, `marginRight`, `marginTop`, `marginBottom` (computed styles vs Figma)
- **Borders:** Compare `borderTop`, `borderBottom`, `borderLeft`, `borderRight` (width, style, color)
- **Height/Width:** Compare fixed dimensions if specified in Figma

**Method:**
1. Get Figma specs (already documented in exercise MD or fetch via API)
2. Find element in Chrome Relay (via snapshot + selector)
3. Run `window.getComputedStyle(element)` for spacing properties
4. Compare Found vs Expected
5. If mismatch → document in Excel

**Nicholas does manually:** States (hover, focus, etc.), Color (hex matching), Typography (font family/weight/size), WCAG compliance

**8️⃣ Document discrepancies:** Add row to Excel with columns below, **check component on MD** (`- [x]`), **update Progress** (e.g., "4 of 12 completed"). Then loop back to 6b.

**Excel columns (10 total):**
- **ID** (sequential)
- **Title** (Component - Check type - Page name, e.g., "Masthead - Spacing (padding left) - Login")
- **Jira task** (linked if related, `=HYPERLINK(url, "CODE: Component Name")` with blue underline style)
- **Status** (default: "To triage")
- **Description** (forensic detail, ENGLISH):
  - **Found:** [actual value + property/element, e.g., "16px (paddingLeft on div.MuiBox-root.css-1snnggj)"]
  - **Expected:** [target value + source, e.g., "8px (Figma node 249:7049 Masthead specification)"]
  - **NO "Impact:" line** (redundant when Title already says check type)
  - **NO "Tested:" line** (Excel file metadata = timestamp)
  - **NO "Chrome computed style" term** (just property name + element)
- **Library version** (WHERE expected value lives, `=HYPERLINK(figma_url, "RPM Pattern Library: Component")` with blue underline)
- **System version** (WHERE found value lives, `=HYPERLINK(page_url, "Page Name")` with blue underline)
- **System image** (blank, screenshots not needed for spacing)
- **Proposed solution** (repeat Figma spec as fix, e.g., "Set padding-left: 8px on Masthead container")
- **Pattern alignment notes** (blank, filled by UX later)

**Excel styling:**
- Copy ALL styles from existing rows (wrap text, alignment, borders, fonts)
- Hyperlinks: blue (`0563C1`) + underline (`single`)
- Use `openpyxl.styles.Font` + `copy()` for style inheritance

**Description format (simplified, ENGLISH only):**
```
Found: 16px (paddingLeft on div.MuiBox-root.css-1snnggj)
Expected: 8px (Figma node 249:7049 Masthead specification)
```

**One row = one discrepancy on one page.** If same discrepancy on 2 pages → 2 rows. If 2 different discrepancies on 1 page → 2 rows.

## When to Use

**Trigger patterns:**
- "compare X with Y"
- "check discrepancies between..."
- "design vs implementation"
- "Figma vs live site"
- Any reference ↔️ live system comparison

**Suggestion conditions:**
- User mentions differences between design and code
- Design review needed
- Component audit requested
- Quality assurance for design system

---

## Phase Details

*See workflow diagram above for complete flow. Details per phase:*

### Phase 1: Environment

**Ask for files, check connections/parity, create MD for documentation.**

**Steps:**
1. **Ask for reference:** Figma link? Documentation URL?
2. **Ask for live system:** Relay ON? Environment URL? Credentials?
3. **Ask for MD:** Does exercise MD exist? Where?
4. **Check connections/parity:** Review `~/.openclaw/workspace/connections/` for relevant info
5. **Create/update MD:** Add all links (reference, live system, reports, Excel)

**Template for MD:**
```markdown
## 📁 Documents (4 Sources)

**Reference (Documentation):**
- [Figma/Docs]: [URL]

**Live System:**
- [Environment]: [URL]
- [Access]: [credentials/relay status]

**Reports:**
- Markdown: [path to this file]
- Excel: [path to Excel file]
- Excel History: [history folder] (max 10 backups)
```

---

### Phase 2: Matching

**Per system page, detect components, list them. User will edit list.**

**Steps:**
1. **Per page in live system:**
   - Inspect DOM (if Relay ON)
   - Take screenshot (if needed)
   - List all visible components

2. **Organize components by scale:**
   - **Macro:** Page layout, grid, sections
   - **Meso:** Component groups (tabs, forms, accordions)
   - **Micro:** Individual elements (buttons, inputs, text)

3. **Output component list in MD:**
   ```markdown
   ## Components Found (Page: [name])
   
   ### Macro
   - [ ] Page header
   - [ ] Main grid layout
   - [ ] Footer
   
   ### Meso
   - [ ] Tab navigation
   - [ ] Form group
   - [ ] Data table
   
   ### Micro
   - [ ] Primary button
   - [ ] Input field
   - [ ] Label text
   ```

4. **User edits list:** Add/remove components, confirm scope

---

### Phase 3: Investigate

**Per each component on the list, investigate discrepancies between system and documentation.**

**Properties to check:**
- **Color:** Background, text, border (compare hex/rgb)
- **Font:** Family, weight
- **Font size:** px/rem/pt
- **Spacing:** Padding, margin
- **Spacing between objects:** Gap, grid spacing
- **States:** Hover, active, disabled, focus (simulate how? ⚠️ QUESTION)

**Steps:**
1. **For each component:**
   - Get reference specs (Figma/docs)
   - Get live system computed styles (Relay → `getComputedStyle()`)
   - Compare properties
   - Document differences

2. **How to simulate states?** ⚠️
   - Hover: Trigger via DevTools?
   - Active: Click and inspect?
   - Disabled: Toggle attribute?
   - Focus: Tab navigation?
   - **User confirm method per exercise**

3. **Log discrepancies:**
   - Component name
   - Property (color, spacing, etc.)
   - Expected (reference)
   - Actual (live system)
   - Impact (minor/major/critical)

---

### Phase 4: Document

**In MD, document all findings. DO NOT touch Excel unless explicitly asked.**

**Workflow:**
1. **List findings in MD** (brief, systematic)
2. **User reviews MD**
3. **User decides** what goes to Excel (if anything)
4. **If asked:** Assist with Excel EXACTLY as requested

**Format in MD:**
```markdown
## 📊 Discrepancies Found

### [Page Name]

#### [Component Name]
- **Property:** [color/spacing/font/etc]
- **Expected (docs):** [value from Figma]
- **Actual (system):** [value from Relay]
- **Impact:** [minor/major/critical]

[Repeat per component]
```

**Excel Rules:**
- ❌ **DO NOT** auto-populate Excel
- ❌ **DO NOT** assume what user wants
- ✅ **ONLY** do EXACTLY what's asked
- ✅ **ASK** if unclear what to add

**Column References (for when asked):**
- **Jira task:** Check `connections/jira.md`, use `=HYPERLINK(url, "CODE: TITLE")`
- **Library version:** Figma API via `connections/figma.md`, use `=HYPERLINK(url, "FILE: PAGE")`
- **System version:** URL from Relay ON, use `=HYPERLINK(url, "PAGE_NAME")`

---

### Phase 5: Excel (May Change)

**Assist user with Excel (images, formulas) if asked.**

**Tasks:**
- Insert images (screenshots, comparisons)
- Write formulas (if needed)
- Format cells
- Backup workflow (see `connections/excel-onedrive.md`)

**Workflow:**
1. Duplicate active file → history folder
2. Edit active file
3. Kill Excel + reopen
4. Cleanup history (keep last 10)

---

## 📋 TODO / Roadmap

### ⚠️ Open Questions

- [ ] **How to simulate component states?** (Phase 3)
  - Hover (DevTools trigger? CSS pseudo-class?)
  - Active (click and inspect?)
  - Disabled (toggle attribute in DOM?)
  - Focus (tab navigation?)
  - **Action:** Research methods, test with Relay ON, document findings

### 🔧 Improvements Needed

- [ ] **Phase 4 syntax finalization** (user working on it)
  - Define exact format for "Discrepancies Found"
  - Excel column descriptions (what goes in each)
  - MD vs Excel split (what's brief, what's detailed)

- [ ] **Phase 5 may change** (Excel workflow)
  - Confirm if Excel stays in workflow
  - Alternative: All-MD approach?
  - Keep monitoring user preference

### 💡 Future Enhancements

- [ ] **Automation ideas:**
  - Screenshot comparison (visual diff tools?)
  - Computed styles extraction script
  - Figma API integration (auto-fetch specs)

- [ ] **Template refinement:**
  - Add more MD templates per exercise type
  - Component checklist templates (per UI pattern)

## Excel + History Workflow

**See:** `~/.openclaw/workspace/connections/excel-onedrive.md`

**Summary:**
1. Duplicate active file → history folder (with timestamp)
2. Edit active file (NOT timestamped copy)
3. Kill Excel + reopen (force reload)
4. Cleanup history (keep last 10)

**History folder structure:**
```
File.xlsx                    ← Active file
File history/                ← Backups
  File-20260210-095530.xlsx
  File-20260210-101245.xlsx
  (max 10, delete oldest)
```

---

## Key Rules

1. **ALWAYS ask for 2 sources** (reference + live system)
2. **ALWAYS ask for exercise MD** (or create)
3. **Document sources BEFORE comparing**
4. **Systematic approach** (macro → meso → micro)
5. **MD = brief, Excel = detailed**
6. **This is Wiley work** (not procrastination)
7. **🔴 READ-ONLY:** Do NOT change system or documentation (Figma, SIT, etc.) - observation only
8. **EDIT ONLY:** Exercise MD (findings, component lists, etc.)

---

## Examples

### Good Flow
```
User: "discrepancy: compare RPM Figma with SIT"

Me: "discrepancy: Preciso de:
     1. Figma link (mapa)
     2. Chrome Relay ON? (território)
     3. Onde está o MD desse exercício?"

User: [provides info]

Me: [opens MD, documents sources, starts comparison]
```

### Bad Flow (Don't Do This)
```
User: "compare design with code"

Me: [starts comparing without asking for sources]
❌ WRONG - no sources documented!
```
