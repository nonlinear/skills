## 

### v0.1.0 - Promoting Skills

**Status:** 🏗️ ACTIVE

**Description:** Marketing and visibility strategy for published skills

**Problem:**
Skills published to ClawHub need better visibility and discovery.

**Solution:**
1. **Portfolio page:** Link published skills on nonlinear.nyc (where? how?)
2. **Better descriptions:** Mermaid diagrams, clear use cases, screenshots
3. **Promotion pipeline:** Newsletter? Social media pins? Community engagement?

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Research: Where to link skills on nonlinear.nyc? (portfolio section, skills page, blog?)
- [ ] Design: Skill showcase template (diagram + description + link)
- [ ] Document: Promotion checklist (when to promote, which channels)
- [ ] Implement: Create portfolio/skills page on nonlinear.nyc
- [ ] Test: Promote reminder-research as pilot (measure installs, feedback)

**Success:**
- Published skills get 10+ installs
- Clear path: publish → promote → measure
- Repeatable promotion workflow
